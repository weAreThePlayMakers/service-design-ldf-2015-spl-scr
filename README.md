We are delighted that SDN will be hosting the first of our service design events during this year’s London Design Festival.

The Service Design Network UK Chapter represents and connects the UK’s Service Design industry. Service Design is an established practice within the UK, with some great companies blazing the trail. SDN UK aims to connect the community and enable knowledge share at all levels.

Come join like-minded service designers for SDN’s first live debate or as we like to call it, Fight Club. Two teams must battle it out but there can only be one winner. Which team has the most persuasive argument? Who’s up against the ropes at the end of each round? You decide!

Featuring Dr. Graham Hill and Hannah Kops vs Dominic Campbell and Carrie Bishop.

This fast-paced event will be kicking off from 18:30pm at Head London on the 26th September 2015. Book your place right here, right now.

[Circular Economy Workshop, We All Design](https://servicedesignldf.wordpress.com/2015/09/07/circular-economy-workshop-we-all-design/)

10am-12.30pm
22 September
Makerversity, Somerset House, New Wing, Lancaster Place, WC2R 1LA

Circular Economy Workshop
Service design is very effective at creating organisational change and has also made a big contribution to social innovation. But it is very rarely part of the discussion around environmental impact and at We All Design we think it should be. We believe that we need to manage our resources better so that we can thrive as a society and business to avoid widespread systemic failure.

Recent years have seen the development of a circular economy as positive driver for reducing environmental impact. At its most basic, the circular economy is a hierarchy of resources, which moves from repair to recycling in a closed loop. For example a mobile phones life can be extended if it is well cared for. Retailers might then pay the customer for the return of the phone and harvest it for valuable parts to recycle the value materials.

But the solution for a circular economy is not all about making better ‘things’. Our experiences at We All Design have taught us that in order to make ‘materials flow’, we need information to flow, customers to have better experiences and business models that embed the full lifecycle of materials involved.

Looking at a diagram of the circular economy hierarchy, service design does not feature in a particular icon, instead it takes place between them in the arrows. In that way service design has massive potential in binding the circular economy together.

For this workshop we want to explore how service design tools can serve to develop the circular economy and what would it look like if we redesigned service design tools so that they can be applied in the context of the circular economy.

A collaboration between FutureGov X Service Design London 
FutureGov is the digital and design company for public services. Over the past seven years, we’ve helped more than a hundred local and national authorities across four continents think differently about public services by combining service, product and organisational design. Service Design London is a community of people interested in service design. It organises regular events for everyone from battle scarred practitioners to the service design curious, providing an important place for people to come together and learn from each other.

About the workshop
In this hands on and interactive session you will experience how it feels to be a service designer in the public sector.

We will share insights on how we’ve worked with public sector organisations to bring lasting, radical change. We will focus on how we’ve made that happen, tactics for change, and how we stay sane in infinite complexity.

The focus of the session will give you the opportunity to flex your creative muscles and try out tools and methods on a real life brief about rethinking how children with special educational needs get to school.

The session will end with the presentation of your solutions and of course pizza and beer.

[Simplifying Voting For Overseas Users, Ziv Lazar](https://servicedesignldf.wordpress.com/2015/09/10/simplifying-voting-for-overseas-users-ziv-lazar/)

25 September 2015
Designersblock, Bargehouse, Oxo Tower Wharf, Bargehouse Street, South Bank, London, SE1 9PH

Overseas voting is a complicated process that needs to be explained in a simple way in order to improve voting rates. Ziv will explain how this was done on the registertovote.gov.uk website.

Ziv currently is working for the Cabinet Office on the ‘Register to Vote’ website. This is a simple looking website that was originally been built by the GDS for UK voters. It and has several legal and business obstacles for a great user experience. So while most UK based users go through it in a 5 minutes process, without too much trouble, Ziv has been focusing on the overseas voters path which has a very different user journey.

[The Social Mining Union: exploring cultural capital and social activism in Lewisham, Tearlach Byford-Flokchart](https://servicedesignldf.wordpress.com/2015/09/08/the-social-mining-union-exploring-cultural-capital-and-social-activism-in-lewisham-tearlach-byford-flokchart/)

14:30
26 September 2015
Designersblock, Bargehouse, Oxo Tower Wharf, Bargehouse Street, South Bank, London, SE1 9PH



Tearlach Byford-Flokchart is an designer and filmmaker; his work is concerned with the pierpherals within communities especially around the work place focusing how as designers we can integrate our concepts within society.

From south London scrapyard to Glencore’s annual general meeting in Switzerland
The Social Mining Union (SMU), aims to reposition the role of the ‘labour union’ (and function of positive activism) within a globalized landscape of a hyper-consumer society, examining the industrial mining industry and peripheral territories it is associated with.

The Social Mining Union looks back at the industrial revolution when large-scale industries were centered on people and place. The paternalism of companies such as Cadbury and Unilever ensured that communities flourished around their places of work, sharing a common ground and an inherent sense of meaning. This affiliation between workers, industry and environment strengthened social and cultural values and cultivated prosperity at an individual level, which consequently had a positive effect on the commercial output.

The Social Mining Union proposes a new form of capital, cultural capital: to develop and facilitate the social connections between work and place and additionally to generate a positive environment for those people with some of the toughest jobs on the planet.



By working with people in Lewisham, London, to generate a hybrid design/mining discipline to venerate social infrastructures built upon the historical hinges of industrial Britain, whilst shifting the context assimilated to value within a global context.

Mining discarded objects from all over New Cross (a district in the south London Borough of Lewisham), and ‘mining’ websites such as Gumtree and Freecycle for discarded computers (E-waste) I proceeded to sell this scrap back into local scrapyards.

Re-contextualizing the Rag and Bone man I wanted to encourage a new form of social activism within the local community of Lewisham.

Using the money earned from the scraped objects I proceeded to buy shares in Glencore (a multinational commodity trading and mining company).

As a shareholder, I gained direct access and was able to infiltrate the annual general meeting of Glencore in May 2014, designing myself as a major shareholder through the infrastructure of business cards and a union website in order to be taken seriously.

This project navigates new ways to engage with global superpowers, using alternative routes to access the centralised hubs and internal structures of these corporations by exploiting public company law (shares) and the by-product of big mining (scrap).

By questioning the role and accountability of shareholders, The Social Mining Union aims to initiate a dialogue between three groups: the miners, the shareholders/management and the unions.

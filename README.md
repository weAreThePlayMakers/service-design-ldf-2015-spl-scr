#SERVICE DESIGN @ LDF 2015

The London Design Festival is a celebration of design. Service designers are now taking part to show the game-changing work they are doing during this world renowned festival.

We are producing a map of service design events going on around the capital during the festival (19-27 September 2015). Find out what the innovative players in the field of service design are doing.
